# Weather App

This project is part of [Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript/lessons/weather-app) [JavaScript path](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript?) Weather App Assignment. This is how I solve this assignment.

## Tasks

[x] Set up a blank HTML document with the appropriate links to your JavaScript and CSS files.

[x] Write the functions that hit the API. You’re going to want functions that can take a location and return the weather data for that location. For now, just console.log() the information.

[x] Write the functions that process the JSON data you’re getting from the API and return an object with only the data you require for your app.

[ ] Set up a simple form that will let users input their location and will fetch the weather info (still just console.log() it).

[ ] Display the information on your webpage!

[ ] Add any styling you like!

[ ] Optional: add a ‘loading’ component that displays from the time the form is submitted until the information comes back from the API
